# Wordle Clone

This project clones the New York Times 'wordle' web game to learn how to interact with the browser using APIs and JSON. The game was built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It retrieves the daily word from a word API.

## About The Game
Wordle is a web-based word game where players have six tries to guess a five-letter word. After each guess, the color of the tiles will change to show how close your guess was to the word.

Green means the letter is in the word and in the correct position.
Yellow means the letter is in the word but in the wrong position.
Gray means the letter is not in the word.
The goal is to guess the hidden word in as few tries as possible. Each day, there is a new hidden word to figure out.

## Technologies Used
This clone is built with:

HTML/CSS/JS
Browser API and JSON to get the word of the day
Local storage to save statistics across sessions

## Running The Game

Your guess history and statistics will be saved across sessions using the browser's local storage.
